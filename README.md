## Getting Started

### Create and design a Simple Weather App from scratch in Flutter.

### The application consists of 2 screens:

- Cities: Shows a list of all cities the user is tracking. There is a button to add a new city. The user can search by typing, or selecting from a list of available cities.
- City weather: When a user clicks a city in the portfolio, a new screen appears that shows various weather information for that city, e.g. temperature, rain, humidity, forecast for the next 10 days, etc.
